Landing Page — Implementation Plan (high-level)

Goal
- Provide a performant, accessible, and responsive landing page that converts visitors:
    hero → product/value → features → social proof → CTA (signup/demo) → footer.

Core Sections
1. Top Navigation
     - Brand/logo (clickable to root)
     - Primary actions: Sign up, Log in, Product (anchor), Docs
     - Mobile: hamburger menu / slide-over or disclosure

2. Hero
     - Prominent headline + short subheadline
     - Primary CTA (Sign up) and secondary CTA (Demo / Learn more)
     - Visual: illustration or screenshot (optimized WebP/AVIF)
     - Consider an optional short animated element (CSS-only where possible)

3. Value / Features
     - 3–5 feature tiles with icons, short text, micro-animations on hover
     - Each tile links to deeper docs or modal details

4. Social Proof / Testimonials
     - Rotating quotes or static logos of customers
     - Lazy-load heavy media

5. How It Works / Steps
     - Short three-step flow with icons

6. Footer
     - Links: Docs, Contact, Privacy, Terms, Socials, Language selector

Data & Interactivity
- Minimal client-side data. For dynamic content (testimonials, stats) fetch from an API endpoint or static JSON.
- Use React state for UI only (menu open, modal). No global state needed initially.
- Signup flows handled by route-linking to /signup or an embedded modal.

Routing & SEO
- Page is publicly routable at "/".
- Server-side/meta: ensure page title, description, OpenGraph meta. Use React Helmet or equivalent.

Accessibility
- Semantic HTML5 landmarks (<header>, <main>, <footer>).
- Keyboard-accessible navigation, focus management for modals/drawers, alt text for images.
- Color contrast checks and ARIA attributes as needed.

Styling & Assets
- Preferred approach: CSS Modules or Tailwind for fast iteration. Keep CSS scoped to components.
- Images: responsive srcset and modern formats; lazy-load non-critical assets.
- Animation: prefer prefers-reduced-motion support.

Performance
- Defer non-critical scripts and third-party embeds.
- Code-split large visual components.
- Optimize images and fonts; use system stack font fallback.

Testing & CI
- Visual regression tests for hero and CTA using Chromatic or Percy.
- Unit tests for interactive pieces (menu, modal) with React Testing Library.
- E2E smoke flow (open page, click CTA) in Playwright.

Analytics & Experiments
- Hook up analytics events for CTA clicks, scroll depth, and signups.
- Consider A/B testing (headline, CTA color) via feature flagging.

File / Component Structure (example)
/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx        <= top-level page (this file)
 /components/Hero.jsx
 /components/FeatureList.jsx
 /components/TestimonialCarousel.jsx
 /components/SiteHeader.jsx
 /components/SiteFooter.jsx
 /styles/landing.module.css

Milestones
- MVP: static hero + features + CTA, responsive and accessible.
- Phase 2: dynamic testimonials, analytics, animations.
- Phase 3: personalization, A/B tests, localization.

Monorepo / Deployment Notes
- Prefetch minimal data for SSR if server-rendered.
- Cache assets on CDN and set proper cache-control for images.

TODO (short)
- [ ] Create SiteHeader and SiteFooter components
- [ ] Implement Hero with primary CTA and image
- [ ] Build FeatureList and wire simple JSON content
- [ ] Add accessibility checks and unit tests
- [ ] Integrate analytics + CI visual tests
